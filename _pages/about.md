I am an educator and technology professional with a background that bridges classroom instruction, instructional technology, and enterprise-scale implementation. Currently, I teach middle school mathematics while designing and supporting technology-enhanced instructional systems that emphasize data-informed decision-making, scalability, and meaningful classroom impact.

My experience spans K–12 education, enterprise consulting, program management, and software-adjacent roles. In education, I integrate instructional technology and assessment workflows to support differentiated learning, intervention, and mastery-based practices. I also support adult learning as an induction mentor and PLC facilitator, working with colleagues to align instruction, analyze data, and implement effective digital tools.

Prior to teaching, I worked in consulting, program management, and account management roles supporting Fortune 1000 organizations. This work involved large-scale implementations, ROI and budget analysis, stakeholder facilitation, and executive-level communication—skills that translate directly to district-wide EdTech planning, adoption, and professional development.

I bring strong technical fluency (web technologies, data analysis, digital design), systems thinking, and a practical understanding of how technology is adopted in real organizations. I am particularly interested in roles focused on instructional technology leadership, EdTech implementation, and supporting educators through thoughtful, sustainable use of technology.

## Overview

This site is a portfolio of digital work spanning **code, documentation, and AI-assisted tools**.  
The projects here focus on clarity, structure, and practical use—things designed to be understood, extended, and reused.

Much of this work sits at the intersection of:
- Software development
- Education
- Technical documentation
- AI-assisted workflows and tooling

The portfolio is intentionally broad. Some projects are polished and complete; others are experiments, prototypes, or evolving references.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Code**  
  Modular examples, utilities, and reference implementations.

- **Documentation**  
  Clear technical writing, guides, and structured notes.

- **AI Tools**  
  Custom GPTs, Gems, and workflow experiments focused on real-world augmentation rather than novelty.

## Contact

If you’d like to get in touch:

- **LinkedIn** — primary contact channel
